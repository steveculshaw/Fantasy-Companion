The raiders ride off</p>\n<p>with several captives and Red wants to give pursuit. Gabe, an alchemist, must stay behind</p>\n<p>to heal the injured, so he gives his friend oil of protection and invests one Power Point in it.</p>\n<p>Protection&rsquo;s normal Range is Smarts and its cost is 2, but since Gabe made it an oil (Range</p>\n<p>of Touch), it counts as the Range Limitation and reduces the cost to 1.</p>\n<p>A few hours later finds Red in hot pursuit of the bandits. She applies the magical oil to her</p>\n<p>armor and rolls Gabe&rsquo;s Alchemy skill. She gets a raise and gains +2 Toughness!
