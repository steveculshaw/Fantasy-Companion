Their potions aren&rsquo;t like those listed in the Treasure chapter&mdash;those last for years, require investment of funds, and are created with the Crafting rules (page 161). Instead, alchemists imbue their potions, grenades, and oils with the powers they&rsquo;ve learned. Narratively, their concoctions are created &ldquo;off-camera&rdquo; some time prior to their use. In game terms, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;cast&rdquo; as the player needs them&mdash;pulling various vials or containers from their alchemist&rsquo;s bag or bandoleer and activating them as needed. ô€‚„ REQUIREMENTS: Smarts d6+ ô€‚„ ARCANE SKILL: Alchemy (Smarts) ô€‚„ STARTING POWERS: Any three from the list below. ô€‚„ POWER POINTS: 15 ô€‚„ AVAILABLE POWERS: Banish, beast friend, blast, blind, boost/lower Trait, burst, confusion, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, empathy, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fear, fly, growth/shrink, healing, intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness, protection, puppet, relief, resurrection, shape change, sloth/speed, slumber, smite, speak language, wall walker, warrior&rsquo;s gift. ô€‚„ POWER EDGES: Alchemists may not take Power Edges except for Artificer, Master Artificer, New Powers, Power Points, and Edges specifically noted for Arcane Background (Alchemist). ô€‚„ POWER MODIFIERS: Alchemists can&rsquo;t use the Selective Power Modifier. ô€‚„ ALCHEMIST&rsquo;S BAG: Concoctions are stored in an alchemist&rsquo;s bag, as are the ingredients, glassware, and other scientific equipment she needs to create them. An alchemist can&rsquo;t activate her powers without her bag. As long as the alchemist has access to her bag, she can also make Alchemical Items (see page 60). GIVING CONCOCTIONS TO OTHERS An alchemist can &ldquo;administer&rdquo; her concoction to nearby allies just like casting any other power. If she wants to give someone a concoction to carry or use later, she states the concoction&rsquo;s power and invests it with any number of her current Power Points. Gifted concoction are created with a specific aspect&mdash;boost Trait (Strength), for example, or sloth (but not speed). The alchemist has no choice in this&mdash;she can&rsquo;t give someone boost Trait without naming the Trait affected, even if her power doesn&rsquo;t normally have the Aspect Limitation. Gifted concoctions last until used or 48 hours pass, whichever comes first. Once their Power Points are used, the alchemist recovers them normally. The recipient rolls the maker&rsquo;s Alchemy skill to activate the concoction, just as if the alchemist were administering or using it herself. Example: Red and Gabe are with a caravan when it&rsquo;s hit by bandits. The raiders ride off with several captives and Red wants to give pursuit. Gabe, an alchemist, must stay behind to heal the injured, so he gives his friend oil of protection and invests one Power Point in it. Protection&rsquo;s normal Range is Smarts and its cost is 2, but since Gabe made it an oil (Range of Touch), it counts as the Range Limitation and reduces the cost to 1. A few hours later finds Red in hot pursuit of the bandits. She applies the magical oil to her armor and rolls Gabe&rsquo;s Alchemy skill. She gets a raise and gains +2 Toughness! Gabe saves her skin&mdash;literally&mdash;even though he&rsquo;s many miles away! 83 ô€‚„ COMPONENTS: Alchemists&rsquo; potions, elixirs, pills, and grenades are expendable, giving them the Material Components Hindrance. ACTIVATION When an alchemist &ldquo;casts&rdquo; a power, the player must describe how it&rsquo;s delivered. Powers with a Range of Self or Touch are usually a consumable potion, edible, pill, salve, or oil. Fatigue from Critical Failure affects the recipient if someone other than the alchemist. Powers with greater Range use misters, bellows, or grenades, with a maximum Range of 12&rdquo; (24 yards). The alchemist &ldquo;throws&rdquo; the grenade or fires the bellows or mister with his Alchemy skill rather than Athletics or Shooting (but treats other projectiles normally). Critical Failure affects the caster normally&mdash;the grenade or mister shatters in his hand, showering him with noxious fumes that cause Fatigue.</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":{},"favorite":false,"isArcaneBackground":true,"requirements":{"value":"Smarts d6+"},"source":"Fantasy"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"apRylOkiWzEcKH9z":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_lzyiv7df1r","path":"Fantasy Companion#/CF_SEP/Arcane Backgrounds#/CF_SEP/Alchemist","color":"#fd3ad9"}}}

For example, a cat might interrupt its task to chase a mouse or take a brief nap, and a dog will almost certainly bark when a stranger approaches. A familiar is a Wild Card with respect to Wounds and rolling a Wild Die with its Trait rolls. It doesn&rsquo;t get Bennies, but the mage can spend his own on its behalf. The familiar can understand its master&rsquo;s speech and vice-versa (others hear only the creature&rsquo;s natural sounds), though concepts are limited to what a member of its species might understand. The familiar has 5 Power Points of its own. It cannot cast spells, but the mage can draw 37 on them as if they were his own. They recharge separately and at the same rate as the mage&rsquo;s. The bond between the familiar and the mage makes it immune to the beast friend power cast by others. Familiars don&rsquo;t advance, but instead gain one of the advantages below for each of its master&rsquo;s Ranks (including Novice) and for every fourth advance the hero gains past Legendary. ô€‚„ SECOND SIGHT: The owner may use the familiar&rsquo;s senses as if they were her own, with a maximum range of 10 miles.

Most are firmly ensconced in their laboratories, surrounded by eclectic machines, spinning orreries, and long tables covered in bubbling concoctions. Some eventually leave their confines to explore the wider world, however, carrying portable inventions with them to protect themselves from the people and things who would do them harm. Tinkerers are highly specialized versions of the Weird Science Arcane Background who rely entirely on mechanical devices. ô€‚„ REQUIREMENTS: Smarts d6+ ô€‚„ ARCANE SKILL: Repair (Smarts) ô€‚„ STARTING POWERS: Any two from the list below. ô€‚„ POWER POINTS: 15 ô€‚„ AVAILABLE POWERS: Blind, bolt, blast, burst, confusion, damage field, darksight, detect/conceal arcana, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fly, light/ darkness, lock/unlock, slumber, stun, wall walker. ô€‚„ WEIRD SCIENCE: T inkerers m ay t ake Edges that require Arcane Background (Weird Science). ô€‚„ CRITICAL FAILURE: A tinkerer who rolls a Critical Failure when activating a device doesn&rsquo;t take Fatigue, but can&rsquo;t use that power again until the device is repaired (an hour&rsquo;s work and a successful Repair roll). TINKERER TRAPPINGS Tinkerers use mechanical devices for their powers. Here are some ideas for the suggested Available Powers. &bull; Blind: Flashing light. &bull; Bolt: A firearm. &bull; Blast: A grenade launcher. &bull; Burst: A bellows-like flamethrower. &bull; Confusion: Pulsing light grenade. &bull; Damage Field: Flammable suit. &bull; Darksight: Goggles. &bull; Detect Arcana: Goggles. &bull; Entangle: Glue grenade. &bull; Environmental Protection: Protective suit. &bull; Farsight: Goggles. &bull; Fly: Collapsible wings. &bull; Light/Darkness: Glowstone, smoke grenade. &bull; Lock/Unlock: Skeleton key. &bull; Slumber: Sleeping gas. &bull; Stun: Shock baton. &bull; Wall walker: Suction cups. 94 ô€‚„ POWERS ARE DEVICES: A tinkerer&rsquo;s powers are expressed entirely through devices, such as foldable wings for the fly power, goggles for darksight or farsight, or a flintlock pistol for bolt.

This uses the tinkerer&rsquo;s Power Points as usual, and treats the ally as the caster for purposes of Range and the like. Allies may not use Power Modifiers when using the inventor&rsquo;s devices as they don&rsquo;t know how to properly &ldquo;tinker&rdquo; with them. ô€‚„ LOST DEVICES: If an enemy takes away a tinkerer&rsquo;s device, any powers associated with it can&rsquo;t be used until it&rsquo;s recovered or remade (d6 hours x the power&rsquo;s Rank). ô€‚„ TOOLS: Tinkerer&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t use Power Modifiers without their tool kit&mdash;a satchel, belt, or bag of spanners, screwdrivers, hammers, and other tools they use to tweak their inventions. ô€‚„ JINX: A t inkerer c an make a R epair roll on any mechanical device he can touch.
